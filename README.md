# UAV-based-Human-Detection-with-YOLOv8
An implementation of a YOLOv8 object detection model, fine-tuned for robust human detection in high-altitude aerial imagery captured by UAVs. This model was trained on a large, custom-aggregated dataset to optimize performance for real-world search and rescue (SAR) operations.
